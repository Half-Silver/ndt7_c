Refactor documentation and add scope disclaimers for public release

This commit updates the project documentation to accurately reflect the
library's capabilities and limitations, making it suitable for public release.

Key changes:

Documentation updates:
- Rewrite README with honest positioning as "NDT7-inspired" library
- Add "Design Goals & Non-Goals" section clarifying project scope
- Change claims from "full NDT7 implementation" to "NDT7-style" testing
- Update JSON output description from "matching" to "inspired by" Cloudflare format
- Add "About This Library" section with use cases and limitations
- Add "Protocol Notes" section explaining what is/isn't implemented
- Add disclaimer: "Metric calculations prioritize repeatability and operational
  usefulness over strict protocol completeness"

Code documentation:
- Add comprehensive file header comments to ndt7.h explaining library scope
- Add implementation notes to ndt7.c about capabilities and limitations
- Add compile-time feature flags (NDT7_HAS_LOCATE_API, NDT7_PROTOCOL_COMPLETE)
- Document that this is not a full protocol-equivalent replacement

New files:
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Contribution guidelines aligned with project scope
- USAGE.md: Comprehensive usage guide with examples
- example.c: Simple example program
- .gitignore: Standard build artifacts and IDE files

These changes address feedback that the library was overstating its capabilities.
The documentation now accurately positions this as a practical, lightweight C
implementation optimized for edge devices and Ubuntu Core, rather than claiming
full protocol compliance.

The library remains functionally unchanged - this is purely documentation and
scope clarification to set appropriate expectations for users and contributors.
